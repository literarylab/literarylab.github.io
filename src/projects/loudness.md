shortdesc: "Measuring the loudness of dialogue, through lenses of semantics, plot, and historic change"

This project explores sound as a product of the novel's voices, using "quiet", "neutral", and "loud" as a schema for grouping and analyzing these voices. The verbs used in tagged dialogue (e.g. "shouted", "said", and "whispered") offer one set of information on loudness, but the project also uses the lense of semantics to explore text uttered at different volumes.

The project had three major parts: examining the intersection of loudness with semantics, exploring how the loudest and quietest sections of a novel affect both the plot and the reader, and using loudness to measure historical change (e.g. in how many voices are loud or quiet.)
