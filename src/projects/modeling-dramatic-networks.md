  Using computer models to identify the fundamental properties of dramatic networks
---

This project arises from a systematic comparison of hundreds of dramatic networks from a dozen different literatures and historical periods. At this stage, we are using computer models to identify the fundamental properties of dramatic networks – with particular attention to the correspondence between genres and patterns of growth – and reflect on the relationship between modeling parameters and aesthetico-critical categories.
