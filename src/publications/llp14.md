  blurb: "After the economic ideology of “Bankspeak”, and the cultural geography of “The Emotions of London”, “Broken Time” is the Literary Lab’s first venture into film studies, to be followed by a pamphlet on art history: a series of investigations which we hope will contribute to establish a common conceptual ground among the different branches of quantitative cultural history."
