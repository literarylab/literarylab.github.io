  blurb: "A literary historian and a sociologist of science analyze how the World Bank presents – and justifies – its role within the global economy. Focusing on the Bank’s semantic and grammatical patterns, Moretti and Pestre provide a path-breaking study of an “institutional” language, and of the neo-liberal rhetoric of recent decades."
